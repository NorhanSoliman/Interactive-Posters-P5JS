# Hide and Seek Interactive Poster

This project, **Hide and Seek Interactive Poster**, is an experimental graphic design concept that explores the interplay of **hidden and exposed elements** through dynamic interactions, graphical composition, and transparency manipulation.

## Concept

The poster is built on the theme of **contrast between hidden and exposed**, emphasizing how elements appear or disappear behind lines, shapes, or other graphical elements. Key concepts explored include:
- **Transparency**: Letters, lines, and grid elements dynamically change visibility based on user interaction.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Transparency and size of elements vary based on `mouseX` position, revealing or concealing parts of the poster.
- **Grid and Typography**: Integration of grid lines and typography to create visually engaging interactions.

## Features

- **Interactive Design**: Users control the poster's visual appearance by moving the mouse.
- **Dynamic Typography**: Letters hide or reveal other letters dynamically based on mouse position.
- **Color Exploration**: Includes reddish hues inspired by the mysterious and suspenseful theme of the Squid Game series.
- **Randomized Sentences**: Displays a mix of sentences with randomized positions for added variation and thematic depth.

## Technical Overview

- **Canvas Setup**: The canvas is divided into a grid for a precise positioning of graphical elements.
- **Mouse Interaction**: The script dynamically adjusts transparency, stroke weight, and text size based on mouse position.
- **Typography**: Custom typography is used for creating the interactive title ("Hide" and "Seek").
- **Transparency Effects**: Elements fade in or out depending on user interaction.
